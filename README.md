# Udacity_FullStack_LinuxServerConfiguration
Linux server configuration project of the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).<br>
For this project I took a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepared it to host one of my web applications. It included securing my server from a number of attack vectors, as well as installing and configuring a database server to serve my [*Item Catalog*](https://github.com/ElisabethStrunk/Udacity_FullStack_ItemCatalog) application as a WSGI app.<br>
<br>
This README gives an overview over the work I did for this project. It also includes links to detailed descriptions of all steps I did along the way. These descriptions are written in a tutorial-like form, so they can be used as guidelines for myself and the whole GitHub community when setting up a Linux server to serve Python 3.7 applications as WSGI apps.<br>
A list of third-party resources I used to complete this project can be found at the end of this README in the *Acknowledgements* section.<br>
<br>
You are very welcome to visit my server:<br>
**IP address**: 3.127.90.165<br>

## Summary of configurations made

I __set up my server__ on an AWS Lightsail instance choosing *Ubuntu 16.04 LTS* for the operating system.<br>
A detailed description of all the steps I performed to achieve this can be found [here](get_your_server.md).<br>

I __secured my server__ by implementing the following security measures:

* Updated all pre-installed packages
* Changed the default SSH port (incl. adjusting the Lightsail firewall)
* Set up an Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)
* Made sure that logging in as root user via SSH is not possible

A detailed description of all the steps can be found [here](secure_your_server.md).<br>

I __set up a new user__ with sudo permissions so that a Udacity grader will be able to inspect my work. I also disabled password authentication and generated an SSH key pair for the new user, to secure SSH connections to my server.<br>
A detailed description of all the steps I performed to achieve this can be found [here](give_grader_access.md).<br>

I __deployed my [*Item Catalog*](https://github.com/ElisabethStrunk/Udacity_FullStack_ItemCatalog) project__ onto my server; a Python 3.7 CRUD application developed with Flask and SQLite.<br>
I performed the following steps to successfully deploy my project:

* Configured and installed a custom build of Python 3.7, incl. SQLite extensions
* Installed Apache2
* Configured and installed a custom build of mod_wsgi
* Loaded the mod_wsgi module into Apache
* Set up a virtual environment for my application to run in
* Created a WSGI application from my [*Item Catalog*](https://github.com/ElisabethStrunk/Udacity_FullStack_ItemCatalog) project
* Set up a virtual host to serve my WSGI app
* Made sure that the .git directories on my server are not publicly accessible via a browser

A detailed description of all the steps I performed, as well as the reasons for the neccessity of custom builds of Python and mod_wsgi can be found [here](deploy_your_project.md).<br>
