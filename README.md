# Udacity_FullStack_LinuxServerConfiguration
Linux server configuration project of the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Summary of configurations made

I __set up my server__ on an AWS Lightsail instance choosing *Ubuntu 16.04 LTS* for the operating system.<br>
A detailed description of all the steps I performed can be found [here](get_your_server.md).<br>

I __secured my server__ by updating all pre-installed packages, changing the default SSH port (incl. adjusting the Lightsail firewall), as well as setting up an Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW).<br>
A detailed description of all the steps I performed can be found [here](secure_your_server.md).<br>

I __set up a new user__ with sudo permissions so that a Udacity grader will be able to inspect my work. I also disabled password authentication and generated an SSH key pair for the new user, to secure SSH connections to my server.<br>
A detailed description of all the steps I performed can be found [here](give_grader_access.md).<br>

I __deployed my [*Item Catalog*](https://github.com/ElisabethStrunk/Udacity_FullStack_ItemCatalog) project__ onto my server, a Python 3.7 CRUD application developed with Flask and SQLite.<br>
I performed the following steps to successfully deploy my project:

* Configured and installed a custom build of Python 3.7, incl. SQLite extensions
* Installed Apache2
* Configured and installed a custom build of mod_wsgi
* Loaded the mod_wsgi module into Apache
* Set up a virtual environment for my application to run in
* Created a WSGI application from my [*Item Catalog*](https://github.com/ElisabethStrunk/Udacity_FullStack_ItemCatalog) project
* Set up a virtual host to serve my WSGI app

A detailed description of all the steps I performed, as well as the reasons for the neccessity of custom builds of Python and mod_wsgi can be found [here](deploy_your_project.md).<br>
